** Doom Emacs Introduction
Doom Emacs is an Emacs distribution with emphasis on vim users.

official Download: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs
(use emacs 27)
** Basic Concepts
*** Projects
- what is .projectile for?
  - having a projectile on a deeper level than the git repository
- adding a project =SPC p a=
*** Workspace
motivation: Suppose you are working on your notes and programming at the same time. If you want to have this processes to be separate, workspaces is the answer for that.
*** Windows
*** Buffers
** Evil Mode (Vim mode for Emacs)
** Organizing Tool (org mode)
- org-lint
- open org-agenda: =SPC n a n=
- set org-agenda files:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/org/"))
  #+END_SRC
** Web Project
- ispell: check spelling of the current buffer
** Python IDE (inferior python)
- install the :lang by =SPC f P= and uncomment python in init.el
  - (python +lsp +poetry)
  - (company +tng)
  - pdb, ipdb, gdb, pdbpp
  - =SPC f f= -> for starting a new file
- compile with =SPC c c=
- start buffer
- run-python
- =CTRL + C CTRL + C=
- imenu =SPC s i=
- Issues
    with org mode:
  + config for tapping in REPL
  + in config.el;
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
      (map! :after comint
          :map comint-mode-map
          "TAB" nil
          [tab] nil)
   #+end_src
  + Suspicious state from syntax checker python-flake8: Flycheck checker python-flake8 returned (error "Process flycheck-python-flake8 not running"), but its output contained no errors: emacs: /home/dave/.local/bin/flake8: No such file or directory
  + pip3 install 'python-language-server[all]'*** REPL
*** Debugging
pdb =SPC :=
*** Testing
** Clojure IDE
*** REPL
- install the :lang by =SPC f P= and uncomment python in init.el
- =SPC := clojure/open-repl
*** Debugging
** File explorer (dired)
*** show directory content
*** file delete/move
*** directory
** ELisp IDE
configure this in init.el
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun myownfuncion ()
       (interactive)
       (insert "hello")
)
(myownfuncion)
#+END_SRC


** Version Control (magit)
- stage and commit: =SPC g g=, then stage with =s=, commtt with =c= and push with =p=
- don't forget to type a message in the commit message
** Package Manager
=SPC := package install
    treemacs
or =SPC f p= -> init.el and uncomment treemacs
    uncomment treemacs
** Customizing
